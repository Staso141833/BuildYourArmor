            Principle of the shocking

          <Typography variant="p">
            The principle of shock involves literally shocking and surprising
            the body by changing different aspects of your training. The body
            has incredible adaptability and can adapt to a training load that
            would be difficult for a horse. However, if you always put your body
            through the same kind of stress, in the same way, it gets used to
            it, and even intense training will produce a smaller response than
            you expected. You can shock him by training with more than usual
            weight; by doing more reps and/or sets; by speeding up your
            training; by reducing the rest time between sets; doing exercises
            you are not used to; doing your exercises in an unusual order; or by
            using any or all of the techniques listed here to increase
            intensity.

            Change itself has the ability to shock the body, even if the
            training, the content or sequence of which you are not used to, is
            already beginning to make less and less demands on your body. But
            you will come to a point where you will find it difficult to make
            further progress without shocking your muscles into becoming bigger
            and stronger, fuller, harder and more embossed. I made a radical
            change to my training by training with super heavy weights once a
            week, usually on Friday. We usually overloaded the muscles with
            weights for a few sets so that we were really training for strength,
            and then rested on Saturdays to recover from muscle soreness. Take a
            look at the strength training pictures Barbell Pushups, Dumbbell
            Pushups, and Dumbbell Pushups as some good examples.

          <Typography variant="p">
            One method of performing forced extra reps is by getting your
            training partner's support with a little extra lift from their side
            to help keep you going. However, I have never liked this method
            because the partner has no way of knowing how much to help you and
            what you are capable of doing on your own. I prefer the type of
            forced reps sometimes called Tuna Night/Rest Workout. In this
            method, relatively heavy weight is used and failure is reached
            during the set. Then you stop, leave the weight for just a few
            seconds, and then do a forced extra rep. Again, you rest for just a
            few seconds before forcing yourself to do another rep. This method
            depends on the rapid initial recovery of the muscles after the
            exercise, and you can use this recovery to perform a few additional
            forced repetitions. If you rest for too long, many of the tired
            fibers regenerate and so you end up using them again instead of
            stimulating new ones. To achieve maximum load using this method, you
            can place the weight on the floor for a moment, pick it up again,
            and push yourself for additional reps. For exercises like deadlifts,
            you can do your reps, let go of the bar, rest for a moment, and then
            push yourself to do a few more.

          <Typography variant="p">
            Doing partial reps when you're too tired to complete a full range of
            motion rep is a shock method I've always used for almost every
            muscle in my body. The method is a particular favorite of Dorian
            Yeats. Dorian did a lot of training where he pushed his muscles past
            the point of instant failure to almost complete exhaustion using
            techniques like forced and partial reps. Partial reps are most
            effective when performed at the end of a set when you are almost
            completely exhausted. For example, if you're doing Scott curls, your
            partner should help you lift the weight, and then you should lower
            it a few degrees, then lift it as much as you can, even if it's just
            a few centimeters. Then you lower it a little more and do a few more
            partial reps from that position, repeating this all the way down
            until your muscles are burning and exhausted.

            Isolated (analytical) training

          <Typography variant="p">
            Analytical training involves focusing your efforts on a specific
            muscle or muscle group, or even on a part of a muscle, with the aim
            of isolating it as much as possible from other muscles. Here's an
            example of what can be obtained from analytical training: when you
            do compound exercises such as the Bench Press, the muscles involved
            are the pectoralis major, triceps, and front deltoids. An exercise
            like Dumbbell Flys, on the other hand, isolates the pectoral muscles
            and allows you to train them at maximum intensity. As a next step,
            you can do dumbbell flyes from a semi-reclining position as a way to
            isolate just the upper pectoral muscles. Taking this to an even
            greater extreme, you can perform the Crossover from a lying
            position, focusing specifically on crossing your arms to get the
            maximum Peak Contraction from the exercise. This would isolate and
            develop the inner-upper part of the pectoralis major muscles.
            Analytical training can allow you to fully develop every part of
            your body, improving the condition of any weak areas and helping you
            achieve the championship level of relief and separation you need.

            Negative (eccentric) repetitions

          <Stack sx={dividerStyles}></Stack>
          <Typography variant="p">
            When you lift a weight using the contractile force of your muscles,
            you are performing what is called a Positive Movement. When you
            lower the weight, in this way the attachment points of the muscle
            move apart, and so you perform a so-called eccentric muscle
            contraction, which in bodybuilding is also called a Negative
            Movement or repetition. Negative reps actually put the tendons and
            supporting structures under more stress than the muscles themselves.
            This is helpful as you want your tendon strength to grow in parallel
            with your muscle strength. To get the most out of negatives (i.e.
            negative reps) in your normal training, always lower the weight
            slowly and under control, rather than just letting it fall". To work
            more focused on negative movements, first try to use the cheat
            method when lifting a weight that would otherwise be too heavy to
            lift using the "strict" method (method- to "cheat" (from the English
            "cheat") is expressed in the use of auxiliary movements on the part
            of the body, so that the movement we are aiming for is not performed
            in isolation by one or a few muscles, but rather by muscles that
            help accomplish the movement's purpose - for example, allowing the
            greater weight to be "thrown" through whole-body movements. The
            "strict" method consists in lifting a given weight with the help of
            precisely defined muscles, without the presence of auxiliary
            movements on the part of other muscles. I.e. this is so-called
            isolated (analytical) training, and then you reduce it slowly and
            deliberately. (See the Cheating method description below.) Your
            muscles can lower a weight under control, even though they cannot
            initially lift it on their own. At the end of a set, when your
            muscles are very fatigued, you can have your training partner help
            you lift the weight a little, and then do the "strict" negatives
            yourself.

            To get even more intensity on negative reps, your training partner
            can push the weight as you lower it, thus forcing you to handle more
            resistance. This should always be performed carefully and gently so
            that the muscles and tendons are not subjected to unexpected and
            sudden movements. Forced negatives are more easily performed using
            machines or ropes than with free weights.

            The Cheat Method

          <Typography variant="p">
            The "Cheat" method (from the English "cheat" - cheat, outwit) is an
            exception to the general rule that "strict" technique is necessary
            in bodybuilding. This type of cheating and outwitting does not
            include the use of carelessness in training technique. This is a
            method where you deliberately use other muscles or muscle groups to
            work in cooperation with the target muscles. It's not something you
            should do all the time, and it's very helpful in achieving certain
            specific goals.

            For example, you do heavy biceps curls with a barbell. You can lift
            the weight 5 or 6 times, and then find that you are too tired to
            perform the movement strictly." At this point you begin to use your
            shoulders and lower back to help lift the weight more easily so you
            can complete another 4-5 reps. However, you're only "cheating" as
            much as necessary so that your biceps continue to work as hard as
            they can. With the Chit method, you're forcing your biceps to
            complete more reps than they could without the help of other muscles
            so that you are putting them under more stress, not less.

          <Typography variant="p">
            Cheating (the "cheat method") is used in bodybuilding to make
            exercises harder, not easier. It is also a way to perform forced
            repetitions without the help of a training partner. However, in
            order for this method to have an effect , you must concentrate on
            making sure that the effort applied by other muscles is precisely
            measured (enough) and not too much, so that the target muscles are
            still forced to contract to their maximum.

            The Heavy Load Method
          </Typography>
          <Stack sx={dividerStyles}></Stack>
          <Typography variant="p">
            The term "heavy load" applies to a variety of approaches used in
            training. For some, this involves multiple extended sets - ie your
            regular reps are followed by forced reps, negatives, forced
            negatives and partials to exhaustion. I've always used this term to
            mean moving to the heaviest weight you can handle (after warming
            up), rather than using the pyramid principle, which consists of
            gradually increasing the amount of weight and simultaneously
            decreasing the number of repetitions. So if I can do strict bicep
            curls with about 30 pounds, instead of gradually working my way up
            to that weight, I do two easy warm-up sets, and then immediately
            pick up the 30-pound dumbbells and do my normal amount of reps and
            sets with this heavy weight, forcing your biceps to work to their
            maximum from start to finish. The key to this type of training is
            not to use a weight that is too heavy for you and to do the normal
            amount of sets and reps - for example, 5 sets of 8 to 12 reps. If
            you can only do 6 or 7 reps, the weight is too heavy.
