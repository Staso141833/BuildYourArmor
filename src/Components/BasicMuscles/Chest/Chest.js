                The pectoralis major consists of three parts clavicle (upper),
                sternocostal (middle) and abdominis (lower), with bodybuilders
                usually distinguishing between upper and middle-lower. The
                starting attachment point for the upper part is the clavicle.
                Along the midline of the body, it attaches to the sternum and the
                cartilages of several ribs. The final catch point is on the crest
                of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The pectoral muscles
                spread out like a fan, covering the ribcage like armor plates
                body. Prikrepeni kŭm grŭdnata kost i rebrata i dostigaĭki do

                Attached to the sternum and ribs and reaching the humerus, these
                muscles allow you to perform movements such as Throwing a ball,
                Pushing a barbell with a wide grip, opening a bottle cap, swimming
                crawls, as well as doing parallel bars . In addition, due to their
                grip on the humerus, they are of great importance when performing
                exercises such as deadlifts. In fact, there is a significant
                interdependence between the chest and back muscles. The breasts
                would not reach their full potential size unless the latissimus
                dorsi muscles in the upper back were fully developed.

                A broad and well-shaped chest is one of the most important
                qualities for any bodybuilder. To achieve this, training with
                different types of exercises is required - to develop the upper
                and middle-lower part of the pectoral muscles, their inner and
                outer parts, as well as to form the transition to the deltoid

                Improving the appearance of the chest is more difficult than many
                bodybuilders think. You may have a huge chest and huge, dense

                shape. The perfect chest, especially if you are interested in
